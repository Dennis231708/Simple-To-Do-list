# Simple To-Do list
a simple to-do list created using react for the front end and json server for a simple backend to store the tasks data.
This project was made to help me refresh my knowledge with react. It was fairly simple but still helped me remember a lot of the core concepts of react like dealing 
with props and state. The project also helped reiterate the importance of using es5, 6 and 7 methods and functions in order to create clean reusable code.
